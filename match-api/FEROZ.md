# MY TASKS:

1. Merge 1 million song dataset features with FMA dataset features
2. First check what features match with the existing FMA features and grab those
3. All mandatory (curently) meta-data is in the ids_to_data.py file
   So the first priority would be to get all these labels for the 1 million songs
4. Any mandatory labels that are missing can be left as NaN for now
5. Other important meta-data that are missing (like track_url, artist_url) can be generated maybe
